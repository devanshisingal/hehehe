               <p>Iâ€™m Devanshi Singal, a BTech student in Information Technology in IIIT Allahbad with a sincere passion for coding and mathematics. I love exploring new technologies and solving complex problems. I have always placed a high value on academics, securing an  97% in my 10th grade and 90% in my 12th. These achievements, along with my performance in the IIT Mains 7040 and Advanced exams, where I secured a rank of 12,567, reflect my commitment to excelling in competitive and challenging environments.


In addition to my academic and technical pursuits, I am equally committed to developing my skills in basketball and table tennis.

Balancing academics, coding, and sports has shaped me into a well-rounded individual eager to take on challenges and make meaningful contributions wherever I go.
